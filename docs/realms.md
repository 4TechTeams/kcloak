Realms
======

> A realm manages a set of users, credentials, roles, and groups. A user belongs to and logs into a realm. Realms are
> isolated from one another and can only manage and authenticate the users that they control.
> â€“ [Core concepts and terms](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#core-concepts-and-terms)

The following call resolves a realm and returns a [RealmDsl](../src/main/kotlin/com/fortechteams/kcloak/RealmDsl.kt)
instance for it:

```kotlin
val kc = KCloak.of(TODO())
val masterRealm = ky.realm("master")

// get realm info 
masterRealm.info()
```

***Note:** As stated in the concept, most functionality is not global, but based on a realm.*

## Auto Creation

When calling `kc.realm("foo")`, by default, the realm will be auto-created if it doesn't exist. This can be disabled by
setting the `createRealmIfNotExists` setting to `false`.

## Updates

Realm settings can be updated with the following call:

```kotlin
masterRealm.update {
  isEnabled = true
  displayName = "Some name..."
  isResetPasswordAllowed = false
  isDuplicateEmailsAllowed = true
}
```
